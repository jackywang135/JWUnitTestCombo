# JWUnitTestCombo

##Problem: 

While publishing JUnit test result report on jenkins, the report stops at the first fail without showing the rest of the test results. 

##Solution:

This combo will allow you to combine all Unit Test into one and dispaly all results on jenkins in a more clear and organized fashion.
